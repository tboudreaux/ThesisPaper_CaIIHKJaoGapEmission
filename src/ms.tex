\begin{abstract}
Previous work has demonstrated a paucity of Hydrogen Alpha emission at the same
  Gaia G Magnitude as the Jao Gap in the solar neighborhood. The exact
  mechanism which results in this paucity is as yet unknown; however, the
  authors of the originating paper suggestion that it may be the result of
  complex variations to a stars magnetic topology driven by the Jao Gaps
  characteristic formation and breakdown of stars radiative transition zones.
  Here I present a brief summary of a potential extension to this work looking
  at Ca II H\&K emission lines. Preliminary work with archival data shows a
  much stronger correlation between the calcium emission lines and the Jao Gap
  than was observed between hydrogen emission and the Jao Gap. If this
  observation withstands further testing then it may provide a new way to
  locate the gap in populations which lack the large counting statistics
  currently required --- and which are only practically available from Gaia
  data at moment.
