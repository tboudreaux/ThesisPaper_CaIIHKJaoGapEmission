\begin{abstract}

  The Gaia M dwarf gap, also known as the Jap Gap, is a novel feature
  discovered in the Gaia DR2 G vs. BP-RP color magnitude diagram. This gap
  represents a 17\% in stellar density in a thin magnitude band around the
  convective transition mass ($\sim 0.35 M_{\odot}$) on the main sequence.
  Previous work has demonstrated a paucity of Hydrogen
  Alpha emission coincident with the G magnitude of the Jao Gap in the solar
  neighborhood. The exact mechanism which results in this paucity is as yet
  unknown; however, the authors of the originating paper suggestion that it may
  be the result of complex variations to a stars magnetic topology driven by
  the Jao Gaps characteristic formation and breakdown of stars radiative
  transition zones. We present a follow up investigating another widly used
  magnetic activity metric, Calcium II H\&K emission. Ca II H\&K activity
  appears to share a similar anomolous behavior as H$\alpha$ does near the Jao
  Gap magnitide. We observe an increase in star-to-star variation of magnetic
  activity near the Jao Gap. This increase may be due to stocastic distubptions
  to the magnetic field originating from the periodic mixing events
  charecteristic of the convective kissing instabilities which drive the
  formation of the Jao Gap.
