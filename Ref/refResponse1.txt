# Referee Response

We would like to thank the referee for their careful reading and critique of
this work. Below, we address each point in the referee response including
describing any changes made to the manuscript. All changes have been placed in
bold face.

## Point 1 (Strong Correlation)
  Ref : Lines 144-: "this is balanced by an apparent stronger correlation
  between..." This claim seems to be unfounded. When looking at the Jao (2023)
  paper on Halpha emission, the results seem much more clear than those presented
  here. Please clarify, or remove this sentence.

  Response : This sentence has been removed. 

## Point 2 (visual discontinuity)
  Ref : Lines 148-149: "There is a visual discontinuity..." This discontinuity only
  becomes clear in Fig. 2. See also the following point:

  Response : This has been addressed by merging figures 1 and 2 into a single figure
  (currently figure 1) with a shared x axis. Further a shaded region has been added to
  the R'HK vs M_G plot in order to more clearly show the change in the spread over
  the domain.

## Point 3 (Location of Gap)
  Ref : Fig. 1&2 are not very clear. First of all, please combine them into a single
  figure with a shared x-axis, similar to fig. 6. Then, the dashed line in fig. 2
  seems to imply that the Jao gap is at M_G=11, whereas the discovery paper (Jao
  et al. 2018) places it closer to M_G=10. All of this is discussed later on, but
  the authors should avoid this confusion by updating the figure to include a
  shaded region that highlights the actual position of the gap. Also, please use
  M_G instead of G Mag, since it needs to be clear that this is the absolute
  magnitude.

  Response : Figure combined (see response to point 2). The actual position of the
  gap has been added as a shaded region as the referee suggests. Further limited discussion
  of the difference between where the discontinuity is and the discovery of the gap
  has been added (though primarily this addresses that that difference exists and then
  points the reader to latter sections where discussion of this difference is more
  flushed out)

## Point 4 (just below)
  Ref : Lines 175&198: "just below" > "below". Same reason as point 3.

  Response : Wording changed to "below" from "just below"

## Point 5 (activity cycles)
  Ref : While I was happy to see that magnetic saturation is accounted for, the
  authors do not discuss the influence of activity cycles. Fig. 8 of Perdelwitz
  et al. (2021) shows a sample of M dwarfs with significant modulation in R'_HK.
  Since the targets from Boudreaux et al. (2022) were observed merely four times
  on average, R'_HK of individual stars could be biased because of the time of
  measurement with respect to possible activity cycles. This is easily resolved
  by giving a typical magnitude of activity cycles of M dwarfs (Fig. 8 in the
  aforementioned paper shows delta(log(R'_HK)))~<0.2, but maybe the authors find
  a better citation). Additionally, the low scatter of the rotation-activity
  relation in Boudreaux et al. (2022) justifies that, on the level of variability
  addressed in this publication, cycles are not relevant. Please include a few
  sentences to clarify this.

  Response : We thank the referee for bringing this point to our attention. We
  have added sentences discussing the relative importance of activity cycles vs. 
  the level of variability which we see here.


# Additional Minor Comments


## Point A
  Ref : Beginning of Sec.2: Perdelwitz et al. (2021) and Boudreaux et al. (2022) use
  two different methods for extracting Ca II H&K fluxes. The authors should
  either include a plot showing the comparison of the results for the overlap in
  the samples, or (if that overlap is two small) include a sentence about the
  expected bias, e.g. based on fig. 6 of Perdelwitz (2021).

  Response : The overlap is only 5 source so a plot is not included. However,
  we find the mean percent difference between these 5 sources and include that
  in a sentence in manuscript. There is an approximately 1.5 percent difference
  on average between the P2021 R'HK measurements and the B2022 measurements.

## Point B
  Ref : Fig. 4&6: Please include the same shaded region highlighting the Jao gap I
  asked for in Fig. 1&2.

  Response :  All figures with show something as a function of Mg have been updated
  to include a hatched region showing the location of the gap.

## Point C
  Ref : Lines 245-: Perdelwitz et al. do not publish rotation periods, but the
  Carmencita catalog from the same collaboration does: Diez Alonso+ (2019,
  2019A&A...621A.126D). Please check whether these values could increase the
  sample. Especially for slow rotators, the data used in this publication to
  derive rotation periods (ASAS, SWASP, K2,...) may be better suited due to the
  longer time scales of available data.

  Response : These rotational periods were already included in the sample and
  they make up the majority of rotational periods which we have access to for
  stars from the P2021 sample. In the machine readable version of table which
  is included as a supplement to this work DA19 in the r_prot column referees to
  periods from Diez Alonso+ 2019.

## Point D
  Ref : Line 352: "Kissing instabilities"; The term is used throughout the paper, but
  I could not find a reference or clear definition.

  Response : Defined Kissing instabilities in the introduction to the paper.

## Point E
  Ref : Section 3: I like this section, since it shows that even a simple toy model
  can reproduce the behaviour in activity variability. My first instinct was to
  ask the authors to include the results from the measurements (fig. 2 ) in fig.
  10, but due to the scale, this does not work. However, I ask that the authors
  think about including this model approach in the abstract, as it highlights a
  clear path forward in investigating the Jao gap.

  Response : Added a sentence to the abstract highlighting this toy model.


# Misc Changes

  Minor spelling and grammatical changes / corrections were made throughout to
  correct typos, these have not been placed in boldface. Further a note has
  been added to the acknowledgments thanking the referee for their careful
  reading and critique of this work.
